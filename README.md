Code Challenge
Create a RESTful web service that stores financial transactions in-memory database and 
returns information about 
those transactions. It is ok that all data is gone with a shutdown/restart of the application. 
The service should be written in Java, and Springboot be started as easily. 
The transactions to be stored have a transaction_id, a type, a currency, and an amount. 
The service should support returning
• All transactions of a type 
• All transactions of a currency. 
• Also, transactions can be linked to each other (using a "parent_id") and the total amount 
involved
for all transactions linked to a particular transaction can also be queried.
In general, we are looking for a good implementation, code quality, and how the 
implementation is tested. 
Do not put the code in a publicly available repository!
